        <h1>A Day in the Life of Kittu</h1>
        <img src="images/kittu.png" alt="A cat named Kittu lying on bed">
        <p>Kittu is the younger one of both and obviously the more <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/zQR7qMJ3Esh0Y/giphy.gif">energetic</a> one. He doesn't like to waste his day sleeping much. He wakes up before the sun, making sure everything happens right in the world. After that he begins his adventurous day. He gossips with his bird friends in the window. He looks around the house for new things to scratch.</p>
        <p>After the morning routine, he eats some food (Curd and rice is his favourite meal). Takes a little nap after it. And then plays a little with Chini (basically heckels Chini).</p>

        <p>Things he like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Watching people, cars, dogs etc.</li>
            <li>Heckling Chini</li>
            <li>Curd and Rice</li>
        </ul>
